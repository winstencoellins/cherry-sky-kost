## Brand & Style

The design system is anchored in a **Corporate Modern** aesthetic with a distinctive "Boutique Hospitality" influence. It targets property owners and managers who value efficiency but demand a premium, high-fidelity experience that reflects the quality of their real estate assets. 

The visual language communicates reliability and warmth. By blending the organic tone of the logo's warm browns with a rigorous, professional slate and off-white infrastructure, the UI avoids the sterile "SaaS" look in favor of something more sophisticated and tactile. The interface should feel spacious, calm, and highly organized, evoking the feeling of a well-managed physical property.

## Colors

The palette is driven by the logo’s core DNA. The **Primary Brown** is used for high-impact touchpoints—active states, primary buttons, and key brand elements—providing a sense of stability and earthiness. **Secondary Black** provides strong contrast for headers and primary navigation, ensuring the UI feels grounded.

The background utilizes a clean **Off-White** to reduce eye strain, while **Slate Gray** is reserved for secondary text and borders. Status indicators follow a standard but refined semantic pattern:
- **Vacant/Paid:** Emeral and Forest greens suggest "Go" and "Clear."
- **Occupied:** A calm blue indicates active status.
- **Unpaid:** A sharp red for immediate attention.

## Typography

This design system utilizes **Plus Jakarta Sans** for all levels of the hierarchy. This typeface was chosen for its modern, geometric construction and its friendly, open apertures which maintain high legibility in data-dense dashboard environments.

Headlines should use a tighter line height and heavier weights to establish clear section breaks. Body text leverages a generous 1.6 line height to ensure property descriptions and lease details are easily digestible. Labels and status chips utilize a slightly increased letter spacing and semi-bold weight to ensure visibility even at smaller scales.

## Layout & Spacing

The layout follows a **Fixed Grid** philosophy for the main content container (max-width 1440px) to maintain a premium, editorial feel, while the sidebar remains fixed to the viewport. An 8px baseline rhythm is applied across the entire system.

- **Grid:** A 12-column system with 24px gutters.
- **Margins:** 32px outer margins ensure content has room to breathe on desktop views.
- **Density:** High density is used within data tables, while "Room" or "Property" cards utilize generous padding (md-lg) to emphasize the high-fidelity nature of the property photos and details.

## Elevation & Depth

Hierarchy is established through **Ambient Shadows** and **Tonal Layers**. Instead of harsh borders, surfaces are separated by subtle shifts in elevation.

- **Base Layer:** Off-white background.
- **Surface Layer (Cards/Containers):** Pure white with a very soft, diffused shadow (Blur: 20px, Opacity: 4%, Color: Secondary Black).
- **Interactive Layer (Hover states):** An increased shadow spread and a slight 2px lift transition.
- **Overlay Layer (Modals/Popovers):** A more pronounced shadow with a subtle tint of the primary brown in the shadow color to maintain brand warmth.

## Shapes

The shape language is consistently **Rounded**, reflecting the welcoming nature of the hospitality industry. Standard UI elements like input fields and small buttons use a 12px radius, while larger containers like property cards and dashboard modules utilize a 16px radius. This softening of the corners balances the professional slate tones, making the dashboard feel accessible and premium rather than purely utilitarian.

## Components

### Buttons & Inputs
Primary buttons use the Primary Brown with white text. Hover states should darken the brown slightly. Inputs use the 12px radius with a Slate Gray border that thickens and changes to Brown on focus.

### Status Chips
Chips are used for "Vacant," "Occupied," "Paid," and "Unpaid." These feature a low-opacity background of the status color with high-contrast text of the same hue (e.g., light green background with dark green text) for maximum accessibility and a modern look.

### Property Cards
Cards are the cornerstone of the system. They feature a top-heavy image area, 16px rounded corners, and a white background. Information is grouped using the typography hierarchy defined in Section 3, with status chips positioned in the top-right corner of the image.

### Navigation Sidebar
The sidebar uses a dark theme (Secondary Black) to contrast with the light content area. Active nav items are indicated by a Primary Brown vertical pill on the leading edge and a shift in text color to white.

### Data Tables
Tables should avoid vertical borders. Horizontal dividers should be 1px Slate Gray at 10% opacity. Headers must be in `label-sm` style for clear categorization.
